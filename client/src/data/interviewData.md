# Bulletpoints to questions
## tell me about a time [job description requirement] what were the result

* Build responsive, mobile friendly and beautiful web applications.
- every app i build needs to be responsive and mobile friendly, that's just standard now a days. as far as being beautiful, well that's relative. i believe a 'beautiful app' is something that gets the user thru the process with ease and with little complication, or not konwoing what to do next or where to go. well, there was one app where due to time constraints we would more concerned about building the app out- mvp man, sometimes products just gotta ship out. 

* Create REST based web services and APIs for consumption by mobile and web platforms.
- working with REST apps i think is one of the things i enjoy the most about development. data is soo important, and building out the proper architechture is vital to any app. i remember when i first learned about postman haha i use it every single time i need to build out the api's make sure data scruture is correct and make sure routing works

* Implement new features in a highly collaborative environment with product managers, UI/UX experts, and fellow engineers.


* Contribute to a future-ready, high quality, and performance code base
- i haven't yet, but i'm ready man. i heard people at google work there forever and get excited when they get to add 1 line of code to the code base. i think that's another reason why i would fit right in here. there's a lot of people that want to get their project 

* Share your technical solutions and product ideas with the team 
- the ideas are endless, toilet buddy, a net that hangs in your toilet to catch your phone, keys, wallet, anything that can fall in. it's picking the right idea to fill it with energy


* 7+ years software engineering experience with expertise in technologies like JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Java
- javascript is my main language, this is what brought me here and it's what i'm strongest on

* 2+ years of experience with AngularJS or ReactJS
- i have under 1 year experience with ReactJS and React Native. 

* Experience with performance optimization techniques
- building out a proper foundation is the best way to optimize something lol. not having multiple nested for loops. knowing when to use ID so you don't have to loop thru things. making sure you can sort when you need to so finding things can be easier. you can use tools like pageSpeed insights from the google developers tools to help you locate areas that need optimization. it'll adit the site and tell you to consider minifying your script or css, or use better images

* Experience with object oriented design and building backend applications with REST API services using Java or Node.js


* Experience designing and developing service-based architectures and/or micro services
* Experience designing data persistence and caching concepts using both SQL and NoSQL DBMS (e.g.: **MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc…)
* Enough DevOps experience to setup, configure and maintain your own dev/build environment (we use AWS & Docker).
* Excellent knowledge of software engineering best practices (e.g. Agile software development, test-driven development, unit testing, code reviews, design documentation, etc…)
* Knowledge of virtualization technologies (e.g.: Docker, Vagrant, etc…)
* Experience with native and/or hybrid mobile development (e.g.: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, ionic, etc…)
* Hardware hacking and prototyping experience (e.g.: Arduino)
* Entrepreneurial / Startup Experience
* UX / UI design Experience
* Bachelor's or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Computer or Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field, or equivalent practical experience


# Tell me about yourself:
I'm actually really excited to be here today. The main reason why is because you guys are expertise in soo many industries that have huge interests in. fintech, automotive, i actually have tons of experience in e-commerce, a lot of it start up experience. i went to school for autotech, and i belive i have a really good understanding of cars in a mechnical sense, and even in a technological sense. they're nodes in a system and both the nodes and system is going to get a drastic make over progressing towards autonomy. i'm super excited about fintech too, i love stocks and coins and i'm actually working on a stock market app to help the user find information about stocks and coins and eventually be able to trade. on there. altho there's apps like coinigy for cryptocurrencies and tradingview for stocks, there's relaly not a good app for both, and i'm trying to solve that. i'm probably most excited about decentralized systems and block chain. decentralization is the future and i want to be a part of strong team to help build that future.

I grew up in a tech household, so i feel it was inevitable for me to become a software engineer. I started building and taking apart computers with my cousins, and then graduated to ripping dvds putting them on ftp servers and posting the login information on irc channels back in the 90s >> 2000's haha. so i feel my experience goes back to when i was 11 years old lol. but now a days i feel like i've found myself thoroughly enjoying building software with react(native). i loove working with api's and data, and building beautiful and powerful mobile apps.  


# greatest streaght / weakness

### strength - 
### strength - debugger
### strength - creativtivy
i think creativity is my greatest strength, and also my ability to use it in different ways. not only do i think i have a good 'eye' for beauty, i also am able to find creative ways to problem solve.i feel like being so creative gives me the ability to think outside of the box and to find solutions that normally you wouldn't find. and i think that also give me the ability to quickly view the big picture for larger projects and concepts and imagine the steps needed to get there or complete something. and maybe not all the steps, but maybe enough to give me the confidence to accept the challenge, so maybe i can see that i would need assistance in one area or another. during the bootcamp i was able to easily grasp most concepts. i rmember when we got to node, it was really really difficult, but was eventually able to come to an understanding of it, then i would immedately got an idea to  make a simple twitter bot will scan stock prices from a list of stocks you rpovide it, and it would send a tweet if it reached your target price 

### weakness - 
### weakness - 
### weakness - distract-o-tron
i think my creativity plays a big part in this too. i easily get distracted, and usually for things that i really like or i'm interested in. that's something ii've known about and started working on a few eyars back. it's really hard for me to not start a million projects and finish zero lol. i think that's why i'm kind of a jack of all trades too. and becoming master of javascript haha. I'm really proud of myself with my market systems app too a full stack app that provides the user with stock market information . this is on it's 4th iteration and is well on it's way to being a completely finished app that hopefully eventually will bring in an income. 


# STAR- Situation-Tasks-Action-Results
- Tell me about a react native app- from start to finish
use STAR
- warhammer
- elaborate- time frame, my role and others. what did we create, why? who cares? what is the purpose? what were the specifc problems and the specific actions took. why am i proud of the action i took?
highlight all the positive things that i'm great at

### Situation: A project that seemed like an simple
- Build a Warhammer app
- there's a needed space for apps that work with table top games
- this app was built for table top gamers specifically for Warhammer
- it's purpose is to provide a way for users to strategize their game play digitally
- There was a total of 8 people in the team, one person ended up dropping out. 
- There ended up being a lot of frustrations and stress due to the time contraint
- Certain group members locked up and didn't reach out to help until much later in the project

### Task: My job duties
- My role was to create all the components and it's functionality except for game logic, but I needed to build the component that held that. 

### Action: Time to get to work: Preparing and Executing
- I built out all the user flow components
- I used tools like draw.io to help me map everything out first
- I started out by first doing a whooleee lot of research
- I immediately jumped into creating a develeopment environment and started messing around with tutorials, reading different articles and thoroughly going thru documentation
- We ended up using API's and components like AsyncStorage and Context

### Results: A pretty important moment in my life!
- The results were an impressive MVP app that was complete even tho we had the very tight time constraint
- I was extremely proud of myself for being able to create something as impressive as Battle Tactics in such a short time frame, and that includes learning the new frame work, WHILE working full time and taking care of my son, whom i have 5 days a week.
- I'm also extremely proud of our team, who stepped up to fulfill the tasks that needed to be done even with all the stress of learning something completely new. 
- This also taught me that
